# encryption-decryprion-tool.cs
This tool uses the AES encryption algorithm to encrypt and decrypt files. It takes a user-provided password and generates a key using the SHA-256 hash function. The encrypted file is saved with a ".encrypted" extension, and the decrypted file is saved with a ".decrypted" extension.
